How It Works
  1. The project contains an HTML file that structures the content, including the button and modal box.
  2. The CSS styles the modal box and button, ensuring the modal box is initially hidden.
  3. The JavaScript adds event listeners to the buttons to show and hide the modal box:
  4. When the "Click me üëÜ" button is clicked, the modal box is displayed by removing the hide class.
  5. When the close button (‚ùå) inside the modal box is clicked, the modal box is hidden by adding the hide class.
